Jef Raskin

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   American computer scientist (1943-2005)

   Jef Raskin (born Jeff Raskin; March 9, 1943 - February 26, 2005) was an
   American human-computer interface expert who conceived and began
   leading the Macintosh project at Apple in the late 1970s.

Early life and education

   Jef Raskin was born in New York City to a secular Jewish family,^[1]
   whose surname is a matronymic from "Raske", Yiddish nickname for
   Rachel. He received a BA in mathematics and a BS in physics with minors
   in philosophy and music from Stony Brook University.^[2] In 1967, he
   received a master's degree in computer science from Pennsylvania State
   University, after having switched from mathematical logic due to
   differences of opinion with his advisor. Even though he had completed
   work typical for a PhD, the university was not accredited for a PhD in
   computer science.^[2] The first original computer application he wrote
   was a music application as part of his master's thesis.

   Raskin later enrolled in a graduate music program at the University of
   California, San Diego (UCSD), but quit to teach art, photography, and
   computer science there. He worked as an assistant professor in the
   Visual Arts department from 1968 until 1974. There, he presented shows
   about toys as works of art.^[3] Raskin announced his resignation from
   the assistant professorship by flying over the Chancellor's house in a
   hot air balloon.^[2] He was awarded a National Science Foundation grant
   to establish a Computer and Humanities center which used several 16-bit
   Data General Nova computers and CRTs rather than the teletypes which
   were more common.

   Along with his undergraduate student Jonathan (Jon) Collins, Raskin
   developed the FLOW programming language for use in teaching programming
   to the art and humanities students. The language was first used at the
   Humanities Summer Training Institute held in 1970 at the University of
   Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. The language has only seven statements
   (COMMENT, GET IT, PRINT IT, PRINT "text", JUMP TO, IF IT IS " " JUMP
   TO, and STOP) and can not manipulate numbers. The language was first
   implemented in Fortran by Collins in under a week. Later versions of
   the language utilized "typing amplification" in which only the first
   letter is typed and the computer provides the balance of the
   instruction eliminating typing errors. It was also the basis for
   programming classes taught by Raskin and Collins in the UCSD Visual
   Arts Department.

   Raskin curated several art shows including one featuring his collection
   of unusual toys, and presenting toys as works of art.^[3] During this
   period, he changed the spelling of his name from "Jeff" to "Jef" after
   having met Jon Collins and liking the lack of extraneous letters.

   Raskin occasionally wrote for computer publications, such as Dr. Dobb's
   Journal. He formed a company named Bannister and Crun, which was named
   for two characters playing in the BBC radio comedy The Goon Show.^[4]

Career history

Apple

Contractor writer

   Raskin first met Apple Computer co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve
   Wozniak in their garage workshop following the debut of their Apple II
   personal computer at the first West Coast Computer Faire. Jobs hired
   Raskin's company Bannister and Crun to write the Apple II BASIC
   Programming Manual. Raskin said "I was talking fifty dollars a page.
   They talked fifty dollars for the whole manual." Upon the Apple II unit
   with the serial number of "2", he reportedly wrote "a literate manual
   that became a standard for the young industry".^[5]^: 108 

Management

   In January 1978, Raskin joined Apple as Manager of Publications, the
   company's 31st employee. For some time he continued as Director of
   Publications and New Product Review, and also worked on packaging and
   other issues. He had concealed his degree in computer science, out of
   concern for cultural bias against academia among the hobby-driven
   personal computer industry. He explained, "If they had known ... they
   might not have let me in the company, because there was such an
   antiacademic bias in the early Apple days."^[5]^: 108 

   From his responsibility for documentation and testing, Raskin had great
   influence on early engineering projects. Because the Apple II only
   displayed uppercase characters on a 40-column screen, his department
   used the PolyMorphic Systems 8813 (an Intel-8080-based machine running
   a proprietary operating system called Exec) to write documentation;
   this spurred the development of an 80-column display card and a
   suitable text editor for the Apple II. His experiences testing
   Applesoft BASIC inspired him to design a competing product, called
   Notzo BASIC, which was never implemented. When Wozniak developed the
   first disk drives for the Apple II, Raskin went back to his contacts at
   UCSD and encouraged them to port the UCSD P-System operating system
   (incorporating a version of the Pascal programming language) to it,
   which Apple later licensed and shipped as Apple Pascal.

   Through this time, Raskin continually wrote memos about how the
   personal computer could become a true consumer appliance. While the
   Apple III was under development in 1978 and '79, Raskin was lobbying
   for Apple to create a radically different kind of computer that was
   designed from the start to be easy to use. In Computers by the
   Millions, he stated that expandable computers like the Apple II were
   too complex, and development was difficult due to the unknown nature of
   the machine the program ran on.^[6] The machine he envisioned was very
   different from the Macintosh that was eventually released and had much
   more in common with PDAs than modern desktop-based machines.

Macintosh

   Raskin started the Macintosh project in 1979 to implement some of these
   ideas. He later hired his former student Bill Atkinson from UCSD to
   Apple, along with Andy Hertzfeld and Burrell Smith from the Apple
   Service Department, which was located in the same building as the
   Publications Department. Secretly bypassing Jobs's ego and authority by
   continually securing permission and funding directly at the executive
   level, Raskin created and solely supervised the Macintosh project for
   approximately its first year. This included selecting the name of his
   favorite apple, writing the mission document The Book of Macintosh,
   securing office space, and recruiting and managing the original
   staff.^[5]^: 111  Author Steven Levy said, "It was Raskin who provided
   the powerful vision of a computer whose legacy would be low cost, high
   utility, and a groundbreaking friendliness."^[5]^: 122 

   The prototype was similar in power to the Apple II and included a small
   9-inch (230 mm) black-and-white character display and floppy drive, in
   a small case. It was text only, as Raskin disliked the computer mouse
   or anything else that could take his hands from the
   keyboard.^[5]^: 111  Several basic applications were built into the
   machine, selectable by pressing function keys. The machine included
   logic to understand user intentions and switch programs dynamically.
   For instance, if the user simply started typing text it switched into
   editor mode, and if numbers are typed it switched to calculator mode.
   In many cases these switches were largely invisible to the user.

     It was clear that Macintosh was the most interesting thing at
     Apple-and Steve Jobs took it over.

   Jef Raskin^[5]^: 111 

   In 1981, after the Lisa team had "kicked him out", Steve Jobs's
   attention drew toward Raskin's Macintosh project, intending to combine
   the Xerox PARC-inspired GUI-based Lisa design to Raskin's
   appliance-computing, "computers-by-the-millions" concept. Steve
   Wozniak, who around then had been co-leading the Macintosh team with
   Raskin, was on hiatus from the company following a traumatic airplane
   accident, allowing Jobs to take managerial lead over the project.^[7]

   Raskin is credited as one of the first to introduce Jobs and the Lisa
   engineers to the PARC concepts, though he ultimately dismissed PARC's
   technology and opposed the use of the mouse.^[5]^: 110  Raskin claimed
   to have had continued direct input into the eventual Mac design,
   including the decision to use a one-button mouse as part of the Apple
   interface, instead of PARC's 3-button mouse.^[citation needed] Others,
   including Larry Tesler, acknowledge his advocacy for a one-button mouse
   but say that it was a decision reached simultaneously by others at
   Apple who had stronger authority on the issue.^[citation needed] Raskin
   later stated that were he to redesign the mouse, it would have three
   clearly labeled buttons-two buttons on top marked "Select" and
   "Activate", and a "Grab" button on the side that could be used by
   squeezing the mouse.^[8] It has the three described buttons (two
   invisible), but they are assigned to different functions than Raskin
   specified for his own interface and can be customized.

   In 2005,^[9] Macintosh project member Andy Hertzfeld remembered
   Raskin's reputation for often inaccurately claiming to have invented
   various technologies. Raskin's resume from 2002 lends credence by
   stating he was "Creator of Macintosh computer at Apple Computer,
   Inc."^[10] Raskin conceived and solely supervised the Macintosh project
   for approximately its first year;^[5]^: 111  however, Hertzfeld
   describes Raskin's relationship to the drastically different finished
   Mac product more like that of an "eccentric great uncle" than its
   father.^[11]^[12] In Jobs's "Lost Interview" from 1996, he refers to
   the Macintosh as a product of team effort while acknowledging Raskin's
   early role.^[13]^[failed verification] Jobs reportedly co-opted some of
   Raskin's leadership philosophies, such as when he wrote the slogan on
   the Macintosh group's easel, "It's better to be a pirate than to join
   the Navy."^[14]^: 271 

   Apple acknowledged Raskin's role after he had left the company by
   gifting him the millionth Macintosh computer, with an engraved brass
   plaque on the front.^[15]

Pioneering the information appliance

   Raskin left Apple in 1982^[16] and formed Information Appliance, Inc.
   to implement the concepts of his original Macintosh concept. The first
   product is the SwyftCard, a firmware card for the Apple II series
   containing an integrated application suite, also released on a disk as
   SwyftWare. Information Appliance later developed the Swyft as a
   stand-alone laptop computer. Raskin licensed this design to Canon,
   which shipped a similar desktop product as the Canon Cat. Released in
   1987, the unit had an innovative interface that attracted much interest
   but it did not become a commercial success. Raskin claimed that its
   failure was due in some part to Steve Jobs, who successfully pitched
   Canon on the NeXT Computer at about the same time. It has also been
   suggested that Canon canceled the Cat due to internal rivalries within
   its divisions. After running a cryptic full page advertisement in the
   Wall Street Journal that the "Canon Cat is coming" months before it was
   available, Canon failed to follow through, never airing the completed
   TV advertisement at launch, only allowed the Cat to be sold by its
   typewriter sales people, and prevented Raskin from selling the Cat
   directly with a TV demonstration of how easy it was to use. Shortly
   thereafter, the stock market crash of 1987 so panicked Information
   Appliance's venture capitalists that they drained millions of dollars
   from the company, depriving it of the capital needed to be able to
   manufacture and sell the Swyft.^[citation needed]

   Raskin wrote a book, The Humane Interface (2000),^[17] in which he
   developed his ideas about human-computer interfaces.

   Raskin was a long-time member of BAYCHI, the Bay-Area Computer-Human
   Interface group, a professional organization for human-interface
   designers. He presented papers on his own work, reviewed the human
   interfaces of various consumer products (such as a BMW car he'd been
   asked to review), and discussed the work of his colleagues in various
   companies and universities.

   At the start of the new millennium, Raskin undertook the building of a
   new computer interface based on his 30 years of work and research,
   called The Humane Environment, THE. On January 1, 2005, he renamed it
   Archy. It is a system incarnating his concepts of the humane interface,
   by using open source elements within his rendition of a ZUI or Zooming
   User Interface. In the same period, Raskin accepted an appointment as
   Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago's
   Computer Science Department and, with Leo Irakliotis, started designing
   a new curriculum on humane interfaces and computer enterprises.

   His work is being extended and carried on by his son Aza Raskin at
   Humanized, a company that was started shortly after Raskin's death to
   continue his legacy. Humanized released Enso, a linguistic command-line
   interface, which is based on Jef's work and dedicated in his memory. In
   early 2008, Humanized became part of Mozilla.^[18]

   The Archy project never included a functional ZUI, but a third party
   developed a commercial application called Raskin inspired by the same
   Zoomworld ZUI idea.^[19]^[20]^[21]

Cognetics

   Raskin expanded the meaning of the term "cognetics" in his book The
   Humane Interface to mean "the ergonomics of the mind". According to
   Raskin Center, "Cognetics brings interface design out of the mystic
   realm of guruism, transforming it into an engineering discipline with a
   rigorous theoretical framework."

   The term cognetics had earlier been coined and trademarked by Charles
   Kreitzberg in 1982 when he started Cognetics Corporation, one of the
   first user experience design companies.^[22] It is also used to
   describe educational programs intended to foster thinking skills in
   grades 3-12 (US)^[23] and for Cognetics, Inc., an economic research
   firm founded by David L. Birch, a Professor at MIT.^[24]

   Raskin discouraged using the informal term "intuitive" in user
   interface design, claiming that easy to use interfaces are often due to
   exposure to previous, similar systems, thus the term "familiar" should
   be preferred.^[25] Aiming for "intuitive" interfaces (based on reusing
   existing skills with interaction systems) could lead designers to
   discard a better design solution only because it would require a novel
   approach.

Outside interests

   Best known as a computer scientist, Raskin had other interests. He
   conducted the San Francisco Chamber Opera Society and played various
   instruments, including the organ and the recorder. His artwork was
   displayed at New York's Museum of Modern Art as part of its permanent
   collection, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the University of
   California, San Diego. He received a patent for airplane wing
   construction,^[26] and designed and marketed radio controlled model
   gliders.

   He was said to be an accomplished archer, target shooter, bicycle racer
   and an occasional model race car driver.^[citation needed] He was a
   passionate musician and composer, publishing a series of collected
   recorder studies using the pseudonym of Aabel Aabius.^[citation needed]
   In his later years he also wrote freelance articles for Macintosh
   magazines, such as Mac Home Journal, and many modeling magazines,
   Forbes, Wired, and computing journals.^[citation needed] One of his
   most favorite pastimes was to play music with his children. He
   accompanied them on the piano while they played or sang while going
   through old fake-books passed down from his father. They routinely
   improvised together.^[citation needed]

   Raskin owned Jef's Friends, a small company which made model airplane
   kits, which were sold through hobby shops.^[27]^[3]

   He was a toy designer. He designed Space Expander, a hanging cloth maze
   for a person to walk through. He designed Bloxes, a set of interlocking
   wood blocks.^[3]

   One of Raskin's instruments was the organ. In 1978 he published an
   article in BYTE on using computers with the instrument.^[28]

   Raskin published a paper highly critical of pseudoscience in nursing,
   such as therapeutic touch and Rogerian science, wherein he said:
   "Unlike science, nursing theory has no built-in mechanisms for
   rejecting falsehoods, tautologies, and irrelevancies."^[29]^[30]

Personal life

   Jef Raskin married Linda S. Blum in 1982. They had three children
   together-Aza, Aviva, and Aenea, with honorary surrogate siblings R.
   Fureigh and Jenna Mandis. In 1985, Raskin described his house as
   "practically one large playground", with secret doors and passageways,
   an auditorium that seats 185, and a model airplane room. He said, "I
   decided when I grew up I was not going to give up the things I liked
   doing, and I've not."^[3]

   He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in December 2004 and died in
   Pacifica, California, on February 26, 2005, at age 61.^[31]
